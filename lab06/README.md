1. I have terrible performance due to directly copy the high level language to HDL, this leads to unnessesary area and combinational logics.
2. Things can be simplify if I can break things down more, coding style and HW design principle does matter.
3. High-level combinational logic block is area-consuming, however, it can ensure the correctness and creation of your baselin model.
4. For optimization, divide your high-level description always block, take the logics out seperatly and treat them like HW by drawing block diagrams and connect things together.
5. Remember the order of computation, the time of selection can impact the area of combinational circuit.
