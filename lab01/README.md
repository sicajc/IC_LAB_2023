# Notes
1. Remember to initialiaze value for every combinational always@* blocks.
2. Remember to do resource sharing, this can be done by instantiating the combinational block out then connect using reg.
3. Can extract the sub-structures out, like in this lab, we can do *W and /3 later after sorting to save even more area.
4. First do a high level programming to make sure that you understand the problem and try to spot what we can optimize here?
