# Lab08
1. Poorly verified lab, if you clearly sense that TA has made an error, you had better wait for the error to be fixed without further trying.
2. Architecture improvement however, can be made first before they fix the error.
3. Clock gating timing violation happends in this lab, I simply removed all clock gating cells afterward, use data gating instead!
4. Using less HW resources and lower power IP is the key to success in this lab
5. Tried pipelined 3-SUM multiplier and adders, they are actually quite easy to use, simply read the datasheet and you are ready to go.
6. JG SEC black boxing IP, lab became extremely frusrating.
