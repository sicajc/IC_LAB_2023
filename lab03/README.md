# Protocal & Pattern
1. AXI-LITE and SPI protocal creation.
2. Coding out pattern and psuedo_SD, pseudo_SD coding style works like a little embbeded machine.
3. The use of ASMD chart for this kind of design is pretty neat and useful!
4. Note nWave would not display MSB 0s. So you might miss some bits during the process.
